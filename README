Perl module Crypt-OpenSSL-AES
=============================

This is Crypt::OpenSSL::AES, an XS-wrapper around
OpenSSL's AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) library.

This module is an alternative to the implementation provided by
Crypt::Rijndael which implements AES itself. In contrast, this
module is simply a wrapper around the OpenSSL library.
